There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
The Kaypro 4 was released in 1984. This is not to be confused with the Kaypro IV that was released in 1983.
•	What operating system does it run? 
It runs CP/M 2.2
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
At the time, it sold for $1,800. Adjusting for inflation, the current approximate cost would be about $4,122. There are currently a few available on ebay, which could be purchased, and none on Craiglist in the DC/Baltimore area. They can be purchased on ebay for less than $200 or $225, which does not suggest that they are terribly difficult to acquire. Because of the weight and size, shipping is a significant portion of this cost.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The Kaypro 4, as well as many of the Kaypro systems were a DEAL. They were sold at a comparatively affordable price at the time, and more than this, they were bundled with software including WordStar, SuperCalc, and dBASE II. The Kaypro IV also improved on the success of earlier Kaypros with increased-capacity double-sided/double-density floppy drives. The Kaypro IV was a CP/M based system, and by about 1985, they were shown to be outperformed by DOS based systems--when the company faced its downfall... 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
I turned it on, asked it to list the directory contents on the disk, started up WS, opened up a document, began to editing and fiddled around a bit with typing and with entering in WordStar specific commands (as per the guide on the keyboard template). The arrows are VERY different, as are the backspace, del, functions for navigating the document. I personally find all of the commands on the template to be quite nice to use. One does not have to memorize the functions, since they are on the template. As a current daily user of both OSX (for school and work) and Windows 8 (on my PC at home), I'm partial to keyboard commands. I really enjoy the instantaneous function of keyboard commands and the ability to bypass the slow, tedious act of constantly using the mouse for visual navigation. So, the Kaypro, I felt, was fast and quick! The display is still old, but you certainly feel the speed on it, which I appreciated.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
Funny tutorial! And interesting how one can't skip through the exercises. Although, I suppose you can choose them. I wasn't able to get onto the Sea Dragon leaderboard! It's quite a lot of noise, so I'll have to try again when it's not the AM in MITH.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
Ran marble springs for a while, navigating around town. Then quite marble springs. On hereis a copy of We Descend, by Bill Bly. It is '895KB of text and graphics' and it takes quite a while to load up... Also, "Miss Sing" is on the desktop.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?

I played a bit of minestorm. Pretty fun! I've played this game quite a bit before, but could only make it into level 2 this time. I really enjoy play these games on vector graphics. Two thigs--the first is, this was a comparatively affordable setup, much more so than many of the systems on these tables. Also, the graphics are particularly responsive to fast-paced gameplay, very different from the systems up here as well.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.

I turned the system on, palyed around a bit with first running kickstart, to run wordbench. I used the lines, dots, boxes, to see the color diversity and graphics capability and stability on the system. Then I ran the appetizers and palyed with the music editor, makinga a short song, but since there are no speakers connected, I was unable to output any sound. Still, the program was quite fun!

MACINTOSH IIci

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?

Both Wordperfect and MS word function MUCH more like our more contemporary word processing counterparts do. Very quick, easy to type on, MT keyboard (believe) has a much lighter response, so is easier to type quickly. The 'delete' button also permits a very quick correction, as opposed to use of error keys to either type over, or to arrow back and then press 'delete' to remove erroneous text. I admit, I find Word Perfect to be a bit nicer, perhaps becayse of its layour onscreen and the buttons available in the default layout, to work on the text. It seems (on face) easier to modify the draft layout on screen in Word perfect that in MS word. I also prefer the vertical cursor alone, that is default on Word PErfect to the additional horiztonal cursor in MS word. MS word also seems to have so many buttons up top, that the layout of the page is distorted and smaller than in Wordperfect. I've drawn some various lines in MacDraw. I've also used some of the patters to created patterned boxes and shapes across the screen. It's running hypercard, which as a very expensive piece of software. It also has the equivalent of hundreds of dollars worth of software on screen. This appears to have been owned by (and possibly still is) by UMD college park's library. There Nonprint media services, then in Hornbake's 4th floor, has a variety of files  onthe computer. Also, they have licensed much of the software on this system, which is additional reason for me to believe it has long been the propery of UMD libary's nonprint services. There are a variety of Nprint (Non print) folders on the hard rvie, with many iels that, upon opening, sort much of the hardware the is available at the university for internal use or for loan.
